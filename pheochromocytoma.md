# Pheochromocytoma

## Definition and Origin

Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine‑secreting tumor that arises from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. In about 80–85% of cases the tumor is unilateral and benign, but it can also occur in extra‑adrenal locations (paraganglioma). The excessive, often paroxysmal, release of norepinephrine and epinephrine drives the characteristic clinical syndrome.

## Cardiovascular Signs

- **Paroxysmal hypertension:** Sudden, severe elevations in blood pressure that may last minutes to hours.
- **Palpitations and tachycardia:** Patients frequently report a sensation of a racing or pounding heart.
- **Arrhythmias:** Ventricular extrasystoles, atrial fibrillation, or other dysrhythmias can be provoked by catecholamine surges.
- **Chest pain:** May mimic angina or acute coronary syndrome due to increased myocardial oxygen demand and coronary vasospasm.
- **Pallor or flushing** of the skin during episodes.

## Neurological Symptoms

- **Headache:** Typically described as severe, throbbing, and often frontal or occipital; it correlates with hypertensive crises.
- **Profuse sweating (diaphoresis):** Episodes of drenching sweats, especially during paroxysms.
- **Anxiety, panic, or a sense of impending doom.**
- **Tremor** of the hands and fingers.
- **Nausea and vomiting** may accompany attacks.

## Ocular Manifestations

Pheochromocytoma can produce several ocular findings, largely secondary to catecholamine‑induced vascular and autonomic disturbances:

1. **Hypertensive retinopathy:** Grade I–IV changes (arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, hemorrhages, exudates, papilledema) may be seen during prolonged or severe hypertensive episodes.

2. **Retinal artery spasm:** Transient vasospasm of retinal arteries can cause visual obscurations or amaurosis fugax.

3. **Spasmodic iris type (iris muscle spasm):** Catecholamine excess can stimulate the pupillary dilator muscle (α1‑adrenoceptors) and the sphincter pupillae (via secondary cholinergic activation), leading to intermittent, painful pupillary constriction and dilation—sometimes described as “iris spasm” or “hippus.” This may be associated with photophobia and blurred vision.

4. **Contraction rings (iris contraction rings):** Rarely, repetitive spastic contractions of the iris sphincter can produce visible concentric rings on the anterior iris surface, known as contraction rings. These are more frequently reported in other autonomic dysfunctions but may appear in pheochromocytoma patients during acute paroxysms.

5. **Other findings:** Episodic mydriasis or miosis, conjunctival injection (due to hypertension), and rarely, ischemic optic neuropathy.

*Note: While spasmodic iris type and contraction rings are not pathognomonic for Pheochromocytoma, they represent potential autonomic ocular signs that should prompt consideration of catecholamine‑secreting tumors when encountered in the appropriate clinical context.*
